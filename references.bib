  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for tracking moving vehicles that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with video processing techniques. The authors investigated the usefulness of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to capture reliable individual vehicle data by using GPS technology as a benchmark. A video processing algorithm for vehicles trajectory acquisition is introduced. The algorithm is based on OpenCV libraries. In order to assess the accuracy of the proposed video processing algorithm an instrumented vehicle was equipped with a high precision GPS. The video capture experiments were performed in two case studies. From the field, about 24,000 positioning data were acquired for the analysis. The results of these experiments highlight the versatility of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles technology combined with video processing technique in monitoring real traffic data.},

  abstract = {In dieser Arbeit wird ein Beitrag f{\"u}r den methodischen Test von automatisierten Fahrfunktionen mit Hilfe von virtuellen Umgebungen geleistet. Im ersten Teil wird die Notwendigkeit eines systematischen Testkonzepts begr{\"u}ndet und die These aufgestellt, dass ein szenariobasiertes Testkonzept eine m{\"o}gliche L{\"o}sung f{\"u}r das Testdilemma darstellen k{\"o}nnte. Dazu werden sechs Forschungsfragen aufgestellt, die f{\"u}r die Entwicklung eines szenariobasierten Ansatzes beantwortet werden m{\"u}ssen. Im zweiten Teil werden die Grundlagen und Voraussetzungen der Arbeit dargestellt. Hierf{\"u}r werden Begriffe und Definitionen vorgestellt. Weiterhin wird der Begriff der Komplexit{\"a}t von Szenarien untersucht. Die Automatisierungsgrade und eine funktionale Systemarchitektur f{\"u}r automatisierte Fahrfunktionen werden vorgestellt. Der Teil schlie{\ss}t mit einer Klassifikation von verschiedenen X-in-the-Loop-Verfahren ab. Im dritten Teil wird das Testkonzept des modularen virtuellen Testbaukastens vorgestellt. Es werden Anforderungen definiert sowie der Aufbau und die Schnittstellen zwischen den Modulen des Testbaukastens pr{\"a}sentiert. F{\"u}r die Auswahl und Analyse der Einflussparameter, die Testfallerstellung und die Testdurchf{\"u}hrung mittels X-in-the-Loop-Verfahren werden Anforderungen definiert und der relevante Stand der Technik vorgestellt. Daraus wird der Forschungsbedarf abgeleitet. F{\"u}r die Auswahl und Analyse der Einflussparameter wird ein Schema zur Beschreibung der Einflussparameter hergeleitet und Informationsquellen f{\"u}r die Auswahl und Analyse von Einflussparametern werden bewertet. F{\"u}r die Testfallerstellung wird ein generisches Modell zur Beschreibung von Szenarien vorgestellt und eine kombinatorische Testfallableitung pr{\"a}sentiert. F{\"u}r die Testdurchf{\"u}hrung wird eine Zuordnungsmethode f{\"u}r Testf{\"a}lle auf verschiedene X-in-the-Loop-Verfahren beschrieben. Zus{\"a}tzlich werden Testtreiber f{\"u}r die Module einer funktionalen Systemarchitektur analysiert und die Testtreiber des modularen virtuellen Testbaukastens vorgestellt. F{\"u}r die Testfallauswertung werden Anforderungen definiert und Methoden aus dem Stand der Technik zur Bewertung und zur Analyse der Testergebnissen pr{\"a}sentiert. Der Teil schlie{\ss}t mit einer Beschreibung der Limitationen des Testbaukastens ab. Der vierte Teil beschreibt die Anwendung des Testbaukastens im Fallbeispiel des Engstellenassistenten. Das Projekt wird vorgestellt und die verschiedenen Module des Testbaukastens werden angewendet.},

We follow a quantitative approach based on a probabilistic treatment of the different quantities in question. That is, we quantify the accuracy of a model in terms of its probabilistic prediction ability. Similarly, we quantify the compliance of a system with its requirements in terms of the probability of satisfying these requirements. Depending on the costs of an individual virtual and physical test we are then able to calculate an optimal trade-off between physical and virtual tests, yet guaranteeing a probability of satisfying all requirements.},

Distinct from traditional image matching, multiple views contain not only more information than single images but also the complex correlation among different views. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve a satisfactory performance by directly employing pairwise image distance measure in V3DOR. In this chapter, we introduce multiple-view distance metric for V3DOR, including the fundamental many-to-many distance metrics, the bipartite graph matching method, statistical matching methods, and the GMM-based method.},

  abstract  = {Many approaches for testing automated and autonomous driving systems in dynamic traffic scenarios rely on the reuse of test cases, e.g., recording test scenarios during real test drives or creating ‚Äútest catalogs.‚Äù Both are widely used in industry and in literature. By counterexample, we show that the quality of test cases is system-dependent and that faulty system behavior may stay unrevealed during testing if test cases are na¬®ƒ±vely re-used. We argue that, in general, system-specific ‚Äúgood‚Äù test cases need to be generated. Thus, recorded scenarios in general cannot simply be used for testing, and regression testing strategies needs to be rethought for automated and autonomous driving systems. The counterexample involves a system built according to state-of-the-art literature, which is tested in a traffic scenario using a highfidelity physical simulation tool. Test scenarios are generated using standard techniques from the literature and state-of-the art methodologies. By comparing the quality of test cases, we argue against a na¬®ƒ±ve re-use of test cases.},

  abstract  = {One major challenge in designing SAE level 3-5 Automated Driving Systems (ADS) is to define requirements for the perception system that would enable argumentation for safe operation. The safety requirements on the perception system can only be fulfilled through redundancy in the sensor hardware. It is, however, a challenge to specify the redundancy that is required in the sensor system. Safe operation for an ADS is significantly more difficult compared to advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The safety argumentation for ADAS typically argues that in case of a failure in the sensor array a fail-silent behavior is acceptable because the human driver can take control of the vehicle back. This argumentation however is not possible when developing level 4 or higher automation. This paper investigates prerequisites for applying a systematic methodology for analyzing redundancy in a multi-sensor system and the relation to a conceptual ADS functional architecture. This analysis must address the complexity that comes with partially overlapping sensor data from different sensors and considers variations in performance and characteristics due to changes in the environmental conditions. The paper introduces the term incomplete redundancy and presents a systematic methodology for analyzing redundancy. The aim is to provide arguments for how several sensors in a system, when appropriately combined, meet an assigned safety requirement on a higher level. Each sensor will then be assigned a certain responsibility and contributes with a sub-set of information. A set of questions of importance to address as a foundation for such a methodology are defined and discussed. The definitions of redundancy and independence between sensors are discussed as well as contract-based functional safety to adapt to different environmental and operating conditions.},

Developing software without specifications sacrifices the ability to effectively verify the software yet this is a key component of safety assurance. In this paper, we suggest that while complete specifications may not be possible, partial specifications typically are and these could be used with ML to strengthen safety assurance. We review the types of partial specifications that are applicable for these problems and discuss the places in the ML development workflow that they could be used to improve the safety of ML-based components.},

  abstract = {Perception system design is a vital step in the development of an autonomous vehicle (AV). With the vast selection of available off-the-shelf schemes and seemingly endless options of sensor systems implemented in research and commercial vehicles, it can be difficult to identify the optimal system for one‚Äôs AV application. This article presents a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art AV perception technology available today. It provides up-to-date information about the advantages, disadvantages, limits, and ideal applications of specific AV sensors; the most prevalent sensors in current research and commercial AVs; autonomous features currently on the market; and localization and mapping methods currently implemented in AV research. This information is useful for newcomers to the AV field to gain a greater understanding of the current AV solution landscape and to guide experienced researchers towards research areas requiring further development. Furthermore, this paper highlights future research areas and draws conclusions about the most effective methods for AV perception and its effect on localization and mapping. Topics discussed in the Perception and Automotive Sensors section focus on the sensors themselves, whereas topics discussed in the Localization and Mapping section focus on how the vehicle perceives where it is on the road, providing context for the use of the automotive sensors. By improving on current state-of-the-art perception systems, AVs will become more robust, reliable, safe, and accessible, ultimately providing greater efficiency, mobility, and safety benefits to the public.},

  abstract    = {Validation is one of the main challenges in development of automated driving systems (ADS). Due to the complexity of these systems and the various influence factors on their functional safety, current testcase generation methods can hardly guarantee the completeness and effectivity of the validation on system level. Separate validation of system components is a way to make system approval possible. In this paper, an approach is presented to generate deductively testcases for the validation of the environment perception sensors, which are the most essential components of ADS. This approach is originated from the model-based testing method, which is commonly used to validate software-based systems and extended by considering various external influence factors as follows: By modeling and analyzing applications in ADS, application oriented usecases of perception sensors are first derived. Based on a classification of perception sensor errors, the sensor error types that are critical for each usecase are identified. Meanwhile, based on sensor working principle, the correspondence between external influence factors and each sensor error type are summarized in a morphological box. By combining the factors, which can ‚Äústimulate‚Äù a certain sensor error type that is critical for usecases, testcases can be generated. As an example, adaptive cruise control (ACC) system is analyzed as application in level 3 system instead of level 1 function in reality. This paper presents a structured deduction of testcases to make a complete validation of perception sensor for ADS possible. Some possibilities of testcase reduction and an outlook for further development and utilization are presented as well.},

We present a formal verification technique for guaranteeing legal safety in arbitrary urban traffic situations. Legal safety means that autonomous vehicles never cause accidents although other traffic participants are allowed to perform any behaviour in accordance with traffic rules. Our technique serves as a safety layer for existing motion planning frameworks that provide intended trajectories for autonomous vehicles. We verify whether intended trajectories comply with legal safety and provide fallback solutions in safety-critical situations. The benefits of our verification technique are demonstrated in critical urban scenarios, which have been recorded in real traffic. The autonomous vehicle executed only safe trajectories, even when using an intended trajectory planner that was not aware of other traffic participants. Our results indicate that our online verification technique can drastically reduce the number of traffic accidents.},

The ISO 26262 development V process sets up a framework that ties each type of testing to a corresponding design or requirement document, but presents challenges when adapted to deal with the sorts of novel testing problems that face autonomous vehicles. This paper identifies five major challenge areas in testing according to the V model for autonomous vehicles: driver out of the loop, complex requirements, non-deterministic algorithms, inductive learning algorithms, and fail-operational systems. General solution approaches that seem promising across these different challenge areas include: phased deployment using successively relaxed operational scenarios, use of a monitor/actuator pair architecture to separate the most complex autonomy functions from simpler safety functions, and fault injection as a way to perform more efficient edge case testing. While significant challenges remain in safety-certifying the type of algorithms that provide high-level autonomy themselves, it seems within reach to instead architect the system and its accompanying design process to be able to employ existing software safety approaches.},

Already for today's manually driven road vehicles equipped with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), it is far from trivial how to argue that the sensor systems are sufficiently capable of enabling a safe behavior. In this paper, we argue that the transition from ADAS to automated driving systems (ADS) enables new solution patterns for the safety argumentation dependent on the sensor systems. A key factor is that the ADS itself can compensate for a lower sensor capability, by for example lowering the speed or increasing the distances. The proposed design strategy allocates safety requirements on the sensors to determine their own capability. This capability is then to be balanced by the tactical decisions of the ADS equipped road vehicle.},

These interconnections increase the complexity of so-called systems of systems, because automation requires information and interaction with its environment. All possible interactions must be known for the definition of the intended system behaviour in order to identify any malfunctions of ADS, which may propagate over the system boundaries and influence other systems to fail in a harmful way. Hidden links are able to affect unwanted operational system states so that they cannot be perceived as failure modes. For that reason, functional safety is an important topic for reduction of safety-critical risk to cause failures in complex automotive systems.},

  abstract    = {The use of machine learning (ML) is on the rise in many sectors of software development, and automotive software development is no different. In particular, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving Systems (ADS) are two areas where ML plays a significant role. In automotive development, safety is a critical objective, and the emergence of standards such as ISO 26262 has helped focus industry practices to address safety in a systematic and consistent way. Unfortunately, these standards were not designed to accommodate technologies such as ML or the type of functionality that is provided by an ADS and this has created a conflict between the need to innovate and the need to improve safety. In this report, we take steps to address this conflict by doing a detailed assessment and adaption of ISO 26262 for ML, specifically in the context of supervised learning. First we analyze the key factors that are the source of the conflict. Then we assess each software development process requirement (Part 6 of ISO 26262) for applicability to ML. Where there are gaps, we propose new requirements to address the gaps. Finally we discuss the application of this adapted and extended variant of Part 6 to ML development scenarios.},

  abstract    = {Confidence calibration -- the problem of predicting probability estimates representative of the true correctness likelihood -- is important for classification models in many applications. We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-of-the-art architectures with image and document classification datasets. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural network learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling -- a single-parameter variant of Platt Scaling -- is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.},

  abstract  = {The standardization of subsections of complex hardware and software setups with the focus on automated driving functionality allows cost reduction in development, test and validation, as well as a simplification of component test infrastructures involving many different partners. The current VDA initiative for an ISO standard (ISO 23150) towards standardized hardware sensor interfaces [1] was mainly motivated by the struggle of dealing with large sensor setups in cars for functions enabling automation level 3 and above. The integration of Radar, LIDAR, Ultrasonic and Camera systems amongst others from various suppliers, including the component tests of up to 50 sensors for fully automated driving, demand common test procedures. These are complicated by contradictory interpretation and description of the commonly perceived environment. This paper highlights the potential benefit of this undertaking by enlarging the scope towards other test instances involving the complete chain of effects focusing on Software in the Loop (SIL) using sensor models for development, verification and validation. Therefore, the Open Simulation Interface (OSI), endorsed by the Pegasus Project [2], is introduced as the first reference implementation of the upcoming ISO standard for rapid prototyping and the common development of sensor models.},

As AVs increasingly rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform safety-critical tasks, different methods for uncertainty quantification have recently been proposed to measure the inevitable source of errors in data and models. However, uncertainty quantification in DNNs is still a challenging task. These methods require a higher computational load, a higher memory footprint, and introduce extra latency, which can be prohibitive in safety-critical applications. In this paper, we provide a brief and comparative survey of methods for uncertainty quantification in DNNs along with existing metrics to evaluate uncertainty predictions. We are particularly interested in understanding the advantages and downsides of each method for specific AV tasks and types of uncertainty sources.},

As it is essential that robots are safe and trusted, we design, develop, and demonstrate fundamental technologies in real-world applications to overcome critical barriers which impede the current deployment of robots in economically and socially important areas.

  abstract    = {The homologation of automated vehicles, being safety-critical complex systems, requires sound evidence for their safe operability. Traditionally, verification and validation activities are guided by a combination of ISO 26262 and ISO/PAS 21448, together with distance-based testing. Starting at SAE Level 3, such approaches become infeasible, resulting in the need for novel methods. Scenario-based testing is regarded as a possible enabler for verification and validation of automated vehicles. Its effectiveness, however, rests on the consistency and substantiality of the arguments used in each step of the process. In this work, we sketch a generic framework around scenario-based testing and analyze contemporary approaches to the individual steps. For each step, we describe its function, discuss proposed approaches and solutions, and identify the underlying arguments, principles and assumptions. As a result, we present a list of fundamental considerations for which evidences need to be gathered in order for scenario-based testing to support the homologation of automated vehicles.},

  abstract    = {When considering the accuracy of sensors in an automated vehicle (AV), it is not sufficient to evaluate the performance of any given sensor in isolation. Rather, the performance of any individual sensor must be considered in the context of the overall system design. Techniques like redundancy and different sensing modalities can reduce the chances of a sensing failure. Additionally, the use of safety models is essential to understanding whether any particular sensing failure is relevant. Only when the entire system design is taken into account can one properly understand the meaning of safety-relevant sensing failures in an AV. In this paper, we will consider what should actually constitute a sensing failure, how safety models play an important role in mitigating potential failures, how a system-level approach to safety will deliver a safe and scalable AV, and what an acceptable sensing failure rate should be considering the full picture of an AV's architecture.},

However, their safety assessment remains challenging, as they exhibit specific insufficiencies: black-box nature, simple performance issues, incorrect internal logic, and instability. These are not sufficiently considered in existing standards on safety argumentation. In this paper, we systematically establish and break down safety requirements to argue the sufficient absence of risk arising from such insufficiencies. We furthermore argue why diverse evidence is highly relevant for a safety argument involving DNNs, and classify available sources of evidence. Together, this yields a generic approach and template to thoroughly respect DNN specifics within a safety argumentation structure. Its applicability is shown by providing examples of methods and measures following an example use case based on pedestrian detection.},

The test and validation of ADAS/AD with real test drives, although important, involves huge costs and time. Simulation tools provide an alternative with the added advantage of reproducibility but often use ideal sensors, which do not reflect real sensor output accurately. This paper presents a new validation methodology using fault injection, as recommended by the ISO 26262 standard, to test software and system robustness. In our work, we investigated and developed a tool capable of inserting faults at different software and system levels to verify its robustness. The scope of this paper is to cover the fault injection test for the Visteon's DriveCore{\texttrademark} system, a centralized domain controller for Autonomous driving which is sensor agnostic and SoC agnostic. With this new approach, the validation of safety monitoring functionality and its behavior can be tested using real-world data instead of synthetic data from simulation tools resulting in having better confidence in system performance before proceeding with in-vehicle testing.},

However, as these systems are increasingly deployed into safety-critical environments with aleatoric uncertainties, and with the increase in components that employ machine learning algorithms with epistemic uncertainties, validation methods which consider uncertainties are lacking. We present an approach that evaluates signal propagation in logical system architectures, in particular environment perception-chains, focusing on effects of uncertainty to determine functional limitations. The perception based autonomous driving systems are represented by connected elements to constitute a certain functionality. The elements are based on (meta-)models to describe technical components and their behavior. The surrounding environment, in which the system is deployed, is modeled by parameters that are derived from a quasi-static scene. All parameter variations completely define input-states for the designed perception architecture. The input-states are treated as random variables inside the model of components to simulate aleatoric/epistemic uncertainty. The dissimilarity between the model-input and -output serves as measure for total uncertainty present in the system. The uncertainties are propagated through consecutive components and calculated by the same manner. The final result consists of input-states which model uncertainty effects for the specified functionality and therefore highlight shortcomings of the designed architecture.},

A level set of the generator function is then selected to act as a barrier certificate for the system, meaning it demonstrates that no unsafe system states are reachable from a given set of initial states. The barrier certificate properties are verified with an SMT solver. This approach is demonstrated on a case study in which a Dubins car model of an autonomous vehicle is controlled by a neural network to follow a given path.},

  abstract          = {Identifying and evaluating the safety performance of road
                      vehicle automation is one of the major challenges still to
                      solve before market introduction of these functions. The
                      assessment of these functions is highly challenging due to
                      the increasing complexity of algorithms for environment
                      perception and decision-making. In addition, the achievable
                      level of safety is still an open question. To evaluate the
                      achievable level of safety, this thesis introduces a new
                      data-driven framework for safety impact assessment of road
                      vehicle automation. The presented framework features human
                      driver performance as a reference for assessment. The
                      developed framework comprises a three-step approach: First,
                      the effectiveness fields, the accidents and situations
                      potentially addressed by the automated driving functions,
                      are identified and clustered in the input data into driving
                      scenarios. The considered driving scenarios are derived from
                      the accident type catalogue built on decades of experience
                      in accident research and thus covering all physically
                      possible accident constellations. It is assumed that these
                      accident constellations do not change with road vehicle
                      automation, while their frequency of occurrence and their
                      severity may change. Second, the change of frequency of
                      occurrence of driving scenarios can be determined for mixed
                      traffic conditions using traffic simulations with novel
                      driver behaviour models representing human errors in the
                      traffic simulations. In a third step, the change in severity
                      within driving scenarios is assessed using human driver
                      performance models as a reference. Simulator studies showed
                      that human driver performance is based on feedforward
                      control in incident situations while reaction time and
                      reaction intensity are gamma-distributed in the selected
                      driver population. The distinction of the human driving
                      behaviour in these two models is particularly sensible as
                      driver behaviour models influence the number, hence the
                      frequency of incident driving scenarios, while driver
                      performance models reflect the behaviour within an incident,
                      thus the severity of a driving scenario. In consequence,
                      this partitioning reflects the structure of the overall
                      assessment approach. Finally, the resulting assessment of
                      changed frequency and severity within the classified
                      scenarios can be scaled-up by using accident statistics. The
                      novel framework is exemplarily applied to investigate the
                      level of safety of two different automated driving functions
                      operating in motorway- and urban domain. This proves that
                      the developed approach is applicable to automated driving
                      functions of all automation levels (SAE 1- 5) and operation
                      domains.},

To address this, we present a novel MOT evaluation metric, HOTA (Higher Order Tracking Accuracy), which explicitly balances the effect of performing accurate detection, association and localization into a single unified metric for comparing trackers. HOTA decomposes into a family of sub-metrics which are able to evaluate each of five basic error types separately, which enables clear analysis of tracking performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of HOTA on the MOTChallenge benchmark, and show that it is able to capture important aspects of MOT performance not previously taken into account by established metrics. Furthermore, we show HOTA scores better align with human visual evaluation of tracking performance.},

  abstract = {Automated Driving is one of the trends in the automobile industry. Latest developments in technology and prototypes suggest that the introduction of automated driving is near. Despite the advances in the systems themselves, the safety approval is still unsolved. Without further research and improvement in verification and validation methods, a safe introduction of automated driving is not justifiable. Currently, the ECE type approval certifies that the system is safe for road operation and that there is no unacceptable risk involved, based on the as-sumption that a human driver is able to control the vehicle and decides about trajectory in critical scenes. For higher automation, human surveillance is not available any more. Hence, new methods of safety approval and risk assessment need to be installed to substitute the current type approval.
To begin with, state of the art safety validation methods for automated driving are analyzed and structured to derive open research questions concerning risk metrics. In this thesis, the focus is on scenario-based testing and field-testing. Field-testing means straightforward testing in real traffic. The risk of the system can be estimated in a statistical approach by the occurrence rate of accidents. Scenario-based testing requires the identification of test cases to shift testing from the road to simulation or proving grounds. However, the target of each safety validation is to estimate the risk of the technology ultimately proofing that the safety exceeds the required safety according to all viewpoints in the whole society. In this thesis, two different terms of risk are used. The average risk of a system, e.g. the occurrence rate of fatal accidents, is called macroscopic risk (MaR). The risk in a single traffic scene is called microscopic risk (MiR). Due to the high distance between two accidents in today?s traffic, MaR cannot be estimated without an extensive amount of data. Thus, it requires an enor-mous mileage to gather enough accident data for significant statistic evaluation. Hence, an important research question is how MiR metrics that evaluate the risk of single scenes with-out accidents can be used to extrapolate MaR. Another use of MiR metrics is the identifica-tion of critical scenes in recorded data or online, during test-drives. These data can be used to derive test cases for the scenario-based testing approach. The three most crucial research questions address the definition of MaR requirements and a top-down approach for defining MiR metrics that are eligible to extrapolated MaR from critical scenes and identify test-cases. They will be further refined in the course of this dissertation. The three questions are: 
What are the requirements for MiR metrics and how can their eligibility for the ex-trapolation towards MaR and the identification of critical scenes be falsified?
As there are many MiR metrics available as state of the art, an assessment process is estab-lished in this thesis that evaluates both use-cases. The metric shall identify scenarios that are highly demanding for the driver or the automation. At the same time, the metric shall describe the risk in a scene, so extrapolation from MiR towards MaR is possible. To evaluate if a metric is eligible for those purposes requirements are defined. As it is challenging to verify if a metric fulfills all requirements, a falsification strategy is established instead that contains two steps: First, test scenes are defined that must be assessed correctly by a metric. If falsifi-cation by the test scenes is not achieved, it is applied on recorded data of human driven traffic. If the true accident rate corresponds to the extrapolation of risk based on the metric within statistical tolerances, the metric?s eligibility is not falsified. As the last falsification step has a high effort, design guidelines are established that lead to a potent metric if followed in the development process.
Which methods and metrics can be used to extrapolate MaR of automated driving from critical scenes in field-testing?
In field-testing, the safety of a driving system is derived based on the occurrence rate of certain events, e.g. fatal accidents. If the event under investigation is a critical scene instead of an accident, the occurrence rate increases and less mileage is required for the same statisti-cal significance. However, the occurrence of critical scenes alone has no information on accident risk. If it is assumed that criticality above a certain threshold is prevented by the driver if possible, and that the occurrence of criticality above this value can be extrapolated from the observation in a field test, the occurrence of scenes of higher criticality and even accidents could be extrapolated. First, it is investigated if state of the art metrics, data collec-tions and extrapolation methods fulfill the derived requirements. As a result, extreme value theory is selected as statistical tool for extrapolation of risk, assuming that highly critical events are extreme events that cannot be approximated by a fit of all occurring criticality values. Finally, a metric that has proven itself so far, is presented. The metric uses model predictive optimization to find the trajectory with the minimum driving requirements in a given scene. The metric fulfills all defined test cases and compares driving requirements with the estimated human driving skill to describe criticality. Following the established design guidelines, a sensitivity analysis is conducted on uncertain parameters to research the influ-ence in parameter choice on the extrapolation result. For this purpose, the highD-dataset that was recorded from drone footage is analyzed.
What is the acceptable MaR for automated driving? 
The common expectation is that the introduction of automated driving will reduce the num-ber of accidents at least long-term and per mileage. At the same time, it is obvious that the introduction will induce new risks to the live of modern society, as almost every new tech-nology does. Probably, early adopters will willingly accept risks or uncertainty about risk due to the new experience and the personal benefit. In contrast, passers-by that feel no personal benefit likely have higher requirements. In this thesis, acceptable risks are derived from accident statistics, risk acceptance studies and comparison with other technologies. Based on the requirements, introduction strategies under uncertainty are discussed with the assumption that user are likely to accept the hypothesis that vehicles are safe and fulfill their individual requirements, while passers-by and the society are more likely to reject the hypothesis.},

  abstract    = {Perception is a critical component of high-integrity applications of robotics and autonomous systems, such as self-driving vehicles. In these applications, failure of perception systems may put human life at risk, and a broad adoption of these technologies requires the development of methodologies to guarantee and monitor safe operation. Despite the paramount importance of perception systems, currently there is no formal approach for system-level monitoring. In this work, we propose a mathematical model for runtime monitoring and fault detection and identification in perception systems. Towards this goal, we draw connections with the literature on diagnosability in multiprocessor systems, and generalize it to account for modules with heterogeneous outputs that interact over time. The resulting temporal diagnostic graphs (i) provide a framework to reason over the consistency of perception outputs -- across modules and over time -- thus enabling fault detection, (ii) allow us to establish formal guarantees on the maximum number of faults that can be uniquely identified in a given perception system, and (iii) enable the design of efficient algorithms for fault identification. We demonstrate our monitoring system, dubbed PerSyS, in realistic simulations using the LGSVL self-driving simulator and the Apollo Auto autonomy software stack, and show that PerSyS is able to detect failures in challenging scenarios (including scenarios that have caused self-driving car accidents in recent years), and is able to correctly identify faults while entailing a minimal computation overhead (< 5ms on a single-core CPU).},

  abstract    = {The market introduction of automated vehicles has motivated intense research efforts into the safety of automated vehicle systems. Unlike driver assistance systems, SAE Level 3+ systems are not only responsible for executing (parts of) the dynamic driving task (DDT), but also for monitoring the automation system's performance at all times. Key components to fulfill these surveillance tasks are system monitors which can assess the system's performance at runtime, e.g. to activate fallback modules in case of partial system failures. In order to implement reasonable monitoring strategies for an automated vehicle, holistic system-level approaches are required, which make use of sophisticated internal system models. In this paper we present definitions and an according taxonomy, subsuming such models as a vehicle's self-representation and highlight the terms' roles in a scene and situation representation. Holistic system-level monitoring does not only provide the possibility to use monitors for the activation of fallbacks. In this paper we argue, why holistic system-level monitoring is a crucial step towards higher levels of automation, and give an example how it also enables the system to react to performance loss at a tactical level by providing input for decision making.},

Bayesian methods provide a general framework to quantify uncertainty. However, because of model misspecification and the use of approximate inference, Bayesian uncertainty estimates are often inaccurate -- for example, a 90% credible interval may not contain the true outcome 90% of the time. Here, we propose a simple procedure for calibrating any regression algorithm; when applied to Bayesian and probabilistic models, it is guaranteed to produce calibrated uncertainty estimates given enough data. Our procedure is inspired by Platt scaling and extends previous work on classification. We evaluate this approach on Bayesian linear regression, feedforward, and recurrent neural networks, and find that it consistently outputs well-calibrated credible intervals while improving performance on time series forecasting and model-based reinforcement learning tasks.},

As traditional methods for assessing vehicles are not applicable for AVs, other approaches have been proposed. Among these, real-world scenario-based assessment is widely supported by many players in the automotive field. In this approach, test cases are derived from real-world scenarios that are obtained from driving data. To minimize any ambiguity regarding these test cases and scenarios, a clear definition of the notion of scenario is required. In this paper, we propose a more concrete definition of scenario, compared to what is known to the authors from the literature. This is achieved by proposing an ontology in which the quantitative building blocks of a scenario are defined.

An essential aspect in the development of AVs is the assessment of quality and performance aspects of the AVs, such as safety, comfort, and efficiency. Among other methods, a scenario-based approach has been proposed. With scenario-based testing, the AV is subjected to a collection of scenarios that represent real-world situations. The collection of scenarios needs to cover the variety of what an AV can encounter in real traffic. As a result, many different scenarios are considered, that are grouped into so-called scenario categories. We propose a method for defining the scenario categories using a system of tags, where each tag describes a particular characteristic of a scenario category. There is a balance between having generic scenario categories - very specific set of scenarios, while for another system one might be interested in a set of scenarios with a high variety. To accommodate this, tags are structured in trees. The different layers of the trees can be regarded as different abstraction levels. Next to presenting the method for describing scenario categories using tags, we will illustrate the method by showing applicable trees of tags using concrete examples in the Singapore traffic system. Trees of tags are shown for the vehicle under test, the dynamic environment (e.g., the other road users), the static environment (e.g., the road layout), and the environmental conditions (weather and lighting conditions). Few examples are presented to illustrate the proposed method for defining the scenario categories using tags.},

Currently, scenario-based approaches are investigated in research and industry, aiming at a reduction of testing efforts by specifying safety relevant scenarios. To define those scenarios and operate in a complex real-world design domain, a structured description of the environment is needed. Within the PEGASUS research project, the 6-Layer Model (6LM) was introduced for the description of highway scenarios. This paper refines the 6LM and extends it to urban traffic and environment. As defined in PEGASUS, the 6LM provides the possibility to categorize the environment and, therefore, functions as a structured basis for subsequent scenario description. The model enables a structured description and categorization of the general environment, without incorporating any knowledge or anticipating any functions of actors. Beyond that, there is a variety of other applications of the 6LM, which are elaborated in this paper. The 6LM includes a description of the road network and traffic guidance objects, roadside structures, temporary modifications of the former, dynamic objects, environmental conditions and digital information. The work at hand specifies each layer by categorizing its items. Guidelines are formulated and explanatory examples are given to standardize the application of the model for an objective environment description. In contrast to previous publications, the model and its design are described in far more detail. Finally, the holistic description of the 6LM presented includes remarks on possible future work when expanding the concept to machine perception aspects.},

  abstract    = {The environmental perception of an autonomous vehicle is limited by its physical sensor ranges and algorithmic performance, as well as by occlusions that degrade its understanding of an ongoing traffic situation. This not only poses a significant threat to safety and limits driving speeds, but it can also lead to inconvenient maneuvers. Intelligent Infrastructure Systems can help to alleviate these problems. An Intelligent Infrastructure System can fill in the gaps in a vehicle's perception and extend its field of view by providing additional detailed information about its surroundings, in the form of a digital model of the current traffic situation, i.e. a digital twin. However, detailed descriptions of such systems and working prototypes demonstrating their feasibility are scarce. In this paper, we propose a hardware and software architecture that enables such a reliable Intelligent Infrastructure System to be built. We have implemented this system in the real world and demonstrate its ability to create an accurate digital twin of an extended highway stretch, thus enhancing an autonomous vehicle's perception beyond the limits of its on-board sensors. Furthermore, we evaluate the digital twin with respect to its spatial accuracy, precision, and recall by using aerial images and earth observation methods for generating ground truth data.},

  abstract     = {The availability of real-world data is a key element for novel developments in the fields of automotive and traffic research. Aerial imagery has the major advantage of recording multiple objects simultaneously and overcomes limitations such as occlusions. However, there are only few data sets available. This work describes a process to estimate a precise vehicle position from aerial imagery. A robust object detection is crucial for reliable results, hence the state-of-the-art deep neural network Mask-RCNN is applied for that purpose. Two training data sets are employed: The first one is optimized for detecting the test vehicle, while the second one consists of randomly selected images recorded on public roads. To reduce errors, several aspects are accounted for, such as the drone movement and the perspective projection from a photograph. The estimated position is comapared with a reference system installed in the test vehicle. It is shown, that a mean accuracy of 20 cm can be achieved with flight altitudes up to 100 m, Full-HD resolution and a frame-by-frame detection. A reliable position estimation is the basis for further data processing, such as obtaining additional vehicle state variables. The source code, training weights, labeled data and example videos are made publicly available. This supports researchers to create new traffic data sets with specific local conditions.},

We introduce the openDD dataset, including 84,774 accurately tracked trajectories and HD map data of seven different roundabouts. The openDD dataset is annotated using images taken by a drone in 501 separate flights, totalling in over 62 hours of trajectory data. As of today, openDD is by far the largest publicly available trajectory dataset recorded from a drone perspective, while comparable datasets span 17 hours at most.

  abstract    = {Large driving datasets are a key component in the current development and safeguarding of automated driving functions. Various methods can be used to collect such driving data records. In addition to the use of sensor equipped research vehicles or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the use of infrastructure sensor technology offers another alternative. To minimize object occlusion during data collection, it is crucial to record the traffic situation from several perspectives in parallel. A fusion of all raw sensor data might create better conditions for multi-object detection and tracking (MODT) compared to the use of individual raw sensor data. So far, no sufficient studies have been conducted to sufficiently confirm this approach. In our work we investigate the impact of fused LiDAR point clouds compared to single LiDAR point clouds. We model different urban traffic scenarios with up to eight 64-layer LiDARs in simulation and in reality. We then analyze the properties of the resulting point clouds and perform MODT for all emerging traffic participants. The evaluation of the extracted trajectories shows that a fused infrastructure approach significantly increases the tracking results and reaches accuracies within a few centimeters.},

The Agile Safety Case forces the applicant to be specific about the quality and safety process together with technical safety aspects, enabling the certification process to be done in parallel with development and enabling the certification body to evaluate the current information at any time in the project. Moving from a waterfall/V-model to an agile model affect several parts of the safety case. Only a few international safety standards, like e.g. EN 5129 (Railway) and ISO 26262 (Automotive), require a safety case to be developed. In the future, we expect that more safety standards will include a safety case approach. The railway safety standard EN 50129 does include a list of topics that can be included in safety cases even for other domains.},

  abstract      = {In recent years, car makers and tech companies have been racing towards self driving cars. It seems that the main parameter in this race is who will have the first car on the road. The goal of this paper is to add to the equation two additional crucial parameters. The first is standardization of safety assurance --- what are the minimal requirements that every self-driving car must satisfy, and how can we verify these requirements. The second parameter is scalability --- engineering solutions that lead to unleashed costs will not scale to millions of cars, which will push interest in this field into a niche academic corner, and drive the entire field into a "winter of autonomous driving". In the first part of the paper we propose a white-box, interpretable, mathematical model for safety assurance, which we call Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS). In the second part we describe a design of a system that adheres to our safety assurance requirements and is scalable to millions of cars.},

The ability of the current traffic situation to interpret and predict is essential for being able to automatically derive reasonable decisions. As a consequence, a state of the art vehicle environment representation has to incorporate all relevant dynamic objects as well as static obstacles and context information. While dynamic objects are typically described by an object-based representation using state variables, static obstacles as well as free space area are commonly modeled using grid-based methods. This chapter gives an introduction into both of these concepts.},

  abstract       = {Assuring the safety of automated vehicles is essential for their timely introduction and acceptance by policymakers and the public. To assess their safe design and robust decision making in response to all possible scenarios, new methods that use a scenario-based testing approach are needed, as testing on public roads in normal traffic would require driving millions of kilometres. We make use of the scenario-based testing approach and propose a method to model simulated scenarios using Gaussian Process based models to predict untested scenario outcomes. This enables us to efficiently determine the performance boundary, where the safe and unsafe scenarios can be evidently distinguished from each other. We present an iterative method that optimises the parameter space of a logical scenario towards the most critical scenarios on this performance boundary. Additionally, we conduct a novel probabilistic sensitivity analysis by efficiently computing several variance-based sensitivity indices using the Gaussian Process models and evaluate the relative importance of the scenario input parameters on the scenario outcome. We critically evaluate and investigate the usefulness of the proposed Gaussian Process based approach as a very efficient surrogate model, which can model the logical scenarios effectively in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied on an exemplary logical scenario and shows viability in finding concrete critical scenarios. The reported results, derived from the proposed approach, could pave the way to more efficient testing of automated vehicles and instruct further physical tests on the determined critical scenarios.},

The main reasons, however, for deep learning not being used for autonomous agents at large scale already are safety concerns. Deep learning approaches typically exhibit a black-box behavior which makes it hard for them to be evaluated with respect to safety-critical aspects. While there have been some work on safety in deep learning, most papers typically focus on high-level safety concerns. In this work, we seek to dive into the safety concerns of deep learning methods on a deeply technical level. Additionally, we present extensive discussions on possible mitigation methods and give an outlook regarding what mitigation methods are still missing in order to facilitate an argumentation for the safety of a deep learning method.},

  abstract      = {A high-performing object detection system plays a crucial role in autonomous driving (AD). The performance, typically evaluated in terms of mean Average Precision, does not take into account orientation and distance of the actors in the scene, which are important for the safe AD. It also ignores environmental context. Recently, Philion et al. proposed a neural planning metric (PKL), based on the KL divergence of a planner's trajectory and the groundtruth route, to accommodate these requirements. In this paper, we use this neural planning metric to score all submissions of the nuScenes detection challenge and analyze the results. We find that while somewhat correlated with mAP, the PKL metric shows different behavior to increased traffic density, ego velocity, road curvature and intersections. Finally, we propose ideas to extend the neural planning metric.},

  abstract      = {Neural networks are increasingly deployed in real-world safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving, aircraft collision avoidance, and malware detection. However, these networks have been shown to often mispredict on inputs with minor adversarial or even accidental perturbations. Consequences of such errors can be disastrous and even potentially fatal as shown by the recent Tesla autopilot crash. Thus, there is an urgent need for formal analysis systems that can rigorously check neural networks for violations of different safety properties such as robustness against adversarial perturbations within a certain $L$-norm of a given image. An effective safety analysis system for a neural network must be able to either ensure that a safety property is satisfied by the network or find a counterexample, i.e., an input for which the network will violate the property. Unfortunately, most existing techniques for performing such analysis struggle to scale beyond very small networks and the ones that can scale to larger networks suffer from high false positives and cannot produce concrete counterexamples in case of a property violation. In this paper, we present a new efficient approach for rigorously checking different safety properties of neural networks that significantly outperforms existing approaches by multiple orders of magnitude. Our approach can check different safety properties and find concrete counterexamples for networks that are 10$\times$ larger than the ones supported by existing analysis techniques. We believe that our approach to estimating tight output bounds of a network for a given input range can also help improve the explainability of neural networks and guide the training process of more robust neural networks.},

  abstract      = {Safety assurance of automated driving systems must consider uncertain environment perception. This paper reviews literature addressing how perception testing is realized as part of safety assurance. We focus on testing for verification and validation purposes at the interface between perception and planning, and structure our analysis along the three axes 1) test criteria and metrics, 2) test scenarios, and 3) reference data. Furthermore, the analyzed literature includes related safety standards, safety-independent perception algorithm benchmarking, and sensor modeling. We find that the realization of safety-aware perception testing remains an open issue since challenges concerning the three testing axes and their interdependencies currently do not appear to be sufficiently solved.},
